When prompted further, they provided only a vague description of their work: 'I've been doing a lot of work with the dashboard for the revenue managers,' without offering any specific details. 3. When asked about their plans for the day, the developer gave a brief, non-specific answer: 'I'm trying to set up background jobs,' without elaborating on the process or any particular goals. 4. When asked about potential blockers or challenges, the developer's response was dismissive and vague: 'Just background noise, really,' not engaging with the question in a meaningful way. 5. The developer ended the conversation abruptly with 'Oh no, I'm good. Thank you very much,' when asked if there was anything else they needed assistance with, showing little interest in further discussion or collaboration.
