## üåü Project Overview

### Title

AI Manager (www.aimgr.dev) - AI-Powered Engineering Management, Starting with Daily Standups

### Abstract

AI Manager brings the power of artificial intelligence to engineering management, starting with revolutionizing daily standups. For the hackathon, we've focused on creating an engaging, voice-enabled daily standup experience that makes remote standups more personal and efficient using advanced AI technology.

### Problem

Remote development teams face several challenges with daily standups:

- Lack of engagement in text-based updates
- Time zone coordination difficulties
- Missing the personal touch of in-person standups
- Inconsistent participation and follow-ups
- Difficulty maintaining a record of daily progress

### Solution

AI Manager's Daily Standup feature addresses these challenges by offering:

- Voice-enabled AI standup calls using ElevenLabs' conversational AI
- Natural conversation flow powered by OpenAI
- Automated scheduling and reminders via Inngest
- Persistent storage of standup records in Neon Database
- Asynchronous participation for distributed teams
