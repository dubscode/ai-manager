# Drizzle ORM Best Practices:

- Use Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations
- Implement proper database connection pooling for improved performance
- Utilize Drizzle's query builder for complex and reusable queries
- Implement proper transaction handling for data integrity
- Use Drizzle's migration system for version-controlled schema changes
- Implement proper error handling and logging for database operations
- Any schema columns that reference another table should have cascade delete enabled
- Index names should be unique and begin with the table name. Example, userIdIndex: index('team_memberships_user_id_idx').on(table.userId)
